# Women-Safety-Device-using-gps-tracking-and-alerts

**A compact IoT-based personal safety device using ESP32-C3 and A9G GSM+GPS module.**

🔧 **Project Overview**<br>
This project is a portable women’s safety device that provides real-time location tracking, emergency SMS alerts, and voice calls during critical situations. Built using the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3 and Ai Thinker A9G module , it uses GSM networks for reliable communication.

🧠 **How it works:** <br>
The system uses the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3 microcontroller along with the Ai Thinker A9G module (combining GSM, GPS, and microphone) to provide:<br>
SOS activation via a long-press button<br>
Real-time GPS location sharing via SMS using Google Maps link<br>
Emergency voice calls to predefined contacts<br>
Low-power design for daily usability<br>

⚙️**Hardware** :<br>
ESP32-C3 :Microcontroller for logic & interfacing<br>
A9G Module :Integrated GSM, GPS, and audio<br>
Push Button :SOS trigger input<br>
3.7V Li-ion Battery :Power supply<br>
